# Example JS server

The script in this directory serves examples as simple wasm embedded canvases.

To use, `go run main.go` with an optional `-port` flag and navigate to `localhost:8080/<example-dir>`.

If the directory has no main.wasm file created to embed, the commands to generate that file will be presented.
